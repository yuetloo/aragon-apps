# Agreement

Aragon Agreements allow organization actions to be governed by a subjective set of rules, that cannot be encoded into smart contracts.

Agreements are the bridge between an Aragon organization and Aragon Court. Organizations with an Agreement can become optimistic: most actions should be easily executed and challenged exceptionally, instead of forcing each user to go through a tedious approval process every time they want to perform an action.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Project stage: development

The Agreement app is still in development phase and aspects of the mechanism are still being designed and implemented.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security review status: pre-audit

The code in this sub-repo is under heavy development and hasn't undergone a professional security review yet, therefore we cannot recommend using any of the code at the moment.
